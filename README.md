# Challenge_Overview
* Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, they’ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data you’ve already retrieved in this module. Then, you'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## Trip 
* The trip will start at Laguna, US, first stop point is Lompoc, US, second stop point is Saint George, US, and third stop is Elko, US, and we will circle back to Laguna. 

## Future Trips
* If you wanted to build up your trip, you can update the coordianate for the cities and you will be able to generate your road trip. If you want to add more stopping point, you can add more vocations_stop with the city cooridnate and remember to update your waypoints as well. Easy to use, get ready for your road trip!
